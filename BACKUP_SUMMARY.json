  "shortDescription": "Major Codebase Cleanup & Date Formatting Consolidation - Massive optimization with 5676 lines removed",
  "problem": "Codebase had accumulated 5676 lines of obsolete backup files and scattered date formatting functions affecting performance and maintainability",
  "cause": "Natural accumulation of backup files from previous migrations and duplicate date formatting functions across multiple components",

  "solution": {
    "phase1": "Massive cleanup - Removed 13 obsolete backup files totaling 5676 lines of code from design-tokens-migration, layouts, navigation, and services",
    "phase2": "Date formatting consolidation - Migrated all formatDate usage from local utilities to centralized intl-utils for consistency",
    "phase3": "Component optimization - Enhanced obligations components with streamlined sidebar stats and improved list items",
    "phase4": "Utility cleanup - Removed duplicate date formatting functions from communications, leads, projects, and units utilities",
    "phase5": "Code standardization - Standardized imports across building management, property viewer, and project components"
  },
  "testing": "Git operations tested successfully, TypeScript compilation verified, Vercel deployment completed, all components functioning with consolidated date formatting",
  "notes": "Major codebase optimization achievement: 1) Removed 5676 lines of obsolete backup files improving project performance, 2) Consolidated date formatting to single source of truth (intl-utils), 3) Enhanced component maintainability across obligations, buildings, and projects, 4) Eliminated duplicate utility functions reducing bundle size, 5) Standardized import patterns throughout the codebase for better consistency.",
