  "problem": "Inconsistent header layout and button styling between Contacts module and other modules (Projects, Buildings, Units). ContactsHeader used 'layout=simple' instead of 'layout=single-row', and ContactDetailsHeader used custom ActionButtons instead of centralized EntityDetailsHeader actions with gradient styling.",
  "cause": "During previous development, Contacts module diverged from the established enterprise patterns. ContactsHeader was configured with different layout mode, and ContactDetailsHeader was using standalone ActionButtons instead of the unified actions prop system used by other modules.",
  "filesChanged": [
    "src/components/contacts/details/ContactDetailsHeader.tsx",
    "src/components/contacts/page/ContactsHeader.tsx"
  ],
  "solution": {
    "phase1": "Analyzed inconsistencies between Contacts and other modules (Projects, Buildings, Units)",
    "phase2": "Standardized ContactDetailsHeader to use EntityDetailsHeader actions prop with gradient styling",
    "phase3": "Fixed ContactsHeader layout from 'simple' to 'single-row' for consistency",
    "phase4": "Added missing viewModes configuration to ContactsHeader",
    "phase5": "Verified all modules now use identical PageHeader and EntityDetailsHeader patterns"
  },
  "testing": "Verified that ContactsHeader now displays with dashboard toggle, view mode controls, and add button like other modules. Confirmed ContactDetailsHeader buttons now use enterprise gradient styling matching Projects, Buildings, and Units.",
  "notes": [
    "✅ ENTERPRISE CONSISTENCY: All module headers now use identical PageHeader configuration",
    "🎨 GRADIENT STYLING: All detail headers use centralized EntityDetailsHeader actions with blue-to-purple gradient",
    "🗑️ CODE CLEANUP: Eliminated custom button implementations in favor of centralized patterns",
    "🏗️ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: Consistent button behavior across entire application"
