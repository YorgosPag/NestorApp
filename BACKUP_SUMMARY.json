  "shortDescription": "Complete Company Contact Forms Synchronization with GEMI Fields",
  "problem": "Company contact creation modal had only 2 basic fields while ContactDetails showed extensive GEMI data with 7 rich tabs. Individual contact forms needed professional details separation. Photo updates weren't propagating correctly across views.",
  "cause": "Form modals and detail views were not synchronized. Missing comprehensive GEMI field structure in company forms. Photo state management had propagation issues.",

    "phase2": "Expanded CompanyContactSection from 2 to 22 comprehensive GEMI fields organized in 4 sections",
    "phase3": "Enhanced IndividualContactSection with separated professional details and communication sections",
    "phase4": "Fixed photo propagation with useEffect and JSON comparison in ContactsPageContent",
    "phase5": "Integrated all form sections with centralized useContactForm hook and proper TypeScript types"
  },
  "testing": "TypeScript compilation verified. Form structure matches ContactDetails tabs. Photo upload and propagation working. All GEMI fields available in company creation modal.",
  "notes": "Next phase: Centralize GEMI field configurations for Single Source of Truth to eliminate code duplication between form creation, editing, and display components.",
