  "problem": "Monolithic formDataMapper.ts (643 lines) with mixed concerns: validation, extraction, mapping, and cleaning logic all in single file. Poor maintainability, tree-shaking, and reusability. Classic 'God Object' anti-pattern requiring modularization.",
  "cause": "Legacy development patterns που δεν ακολουθούσαν enterprise separation of concerns. Mixed responsibilities in single file causing maintenance difficulties και poor developer experience.",
