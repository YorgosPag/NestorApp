  "category": "FIX",
  "shortDescription": "Email Links Now Open Gmail Directly (Desktop Compatibility)",
  "problem": "Email links using mailto: protocol were not working on desktop computers - clicking them did nothing because Chrome had no configured default email client",
  "cause": "Desktop browsers require a configured email client for mailto: links to work, while mobile devices handle this automatically through their built-in mail apps",
  "filesChanged": [
    "src/components/generic/IndividualFormRenderer.tsx",
    "src/components/contacts/details/ContactInfo.tsx",
    "src/components/contacts/list/ContactListItem.tsx",
    "src/components/compositions/ContactCard/ContactCard.tsx"
  ],
  "solution": {
    "phase1": "Identified that ContactInfo.tsx was not the actual component being used in the contact details view",
    "phase2": "Found that IndividualFormRenderer.tsx was the main component rendering contact fields in disabled mode",
    "phase3": "Created clickable links that display instead of disabled input fields when in read-only mode",
    "phase4": "Replaced all mailto: links with direct Gmail web interface URLs (https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&to=email)",
    "phase5": "Updated all contact-related components to use the new Gmail direct links"
  },
  "testing": "User confirmed that email links now work on desktop - clicking them opens Gmail in a new tab",
  "notes": [
    "Phone links (tel:) were already working on desktop and remain unchanged",
    "Email links now work universally without requiring browser email client configuration",
    "Added target='_blank' and rel='noopener noreferrer' for security and UX",
    "All email links now open Gmail compose window with pre-filled recipient"
