  "shortDescription": "ParkingTabs Centralization and Smart Navigation Factory Enhancement",
  "problem": "ParkingTabs component had 200+ lines of duplicate configuration logic that should be centralized. Smart navigation factory needed extension for parking-specific features.",
  "cause": "Configuration was hardcoded in component instead of using centralized factory patterns. This violated DRY principles and made maintenance difficult.",
