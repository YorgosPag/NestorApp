It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.
Installing dependencies

If you are not trying to use TypeScript, please remove the tsconfig.json file from your package root (and any TypeScript files in your app and pages directories).


Installing devDependencies (yarn):
- typescript

yarn add v1.22.22
info No lockfile found.
error Running this command will add the dependency to the workspace root rather than the workspace itself, which might not 
be what you want - if you really meant it, make it explicit by running this command again with the -W flag (or --ignore-workspace-root-check).
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.
Failed to install required TypeScript dependencies, please install them manually to continue:
yarn add --exact --dev typescript

{ command: 'yarn add --exact --dev typescript' }
