/**
 * bim3d-edit-math.ts — SSoT coordinate bridge for 3D BIM element editing.
 *
 * ADR-402 Phase 1. Pure functions — no React, no Three.js scene mutations.
 *
 * The 3D edit gizmos translate a pointer drag in Three.js world space into the
 * 2D `Point2D` (mm) deltas that the existing, view-agnostic commands
 * (`MoveEntityCommand`, `RotateEntityCommand`, the parametric `commit*GripDrag`
 * helpers) already understand. This module is the ONLY place that performs that
 * world↔DXF delta conversion, so the move hook and the rotate hook never
 * duplicate the sign/scale math.
 *
 * Coordinate convention (see coordinate-transforms.ts):
 *   DXF plan  — x = east (mm), y = north (mm), z = elevation (mm)
 *   3D world  — x = east (m),  y = elevation (m), z = -north (m), Y-up
