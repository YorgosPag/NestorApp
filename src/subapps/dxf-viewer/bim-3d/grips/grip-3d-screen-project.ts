/**
 * grip-3d-screen-project.ts — PURE plan(mm) → canvas-local(px) projector for the 3D
 * reshape-grip OVERLAY (ADR-535 Φ5).
 *
 * Φ5 replaces the in-scene grip cubes (WebGL meshes) with a Canvas2D overlay that draws
 * the SAME 2D `UnifiedGripRenderer` — one render code, identical size/shape/colour, and
 * continuous (per-frame) zoom. This is the ONE projection SSoT shared by the overlay's
 * draw loop AND the controller's screen-space hit-test, so a grip is drawn and picked at
 * the exact same pixel.
 *
 * Reuses the `dxfPlanToWorld` + `worldToScreen` coordinate SSoT. `worldToScreen` returns
 * CLIENT px (it adds the canvas `rect.left/top`); the overlay canvas covers the viewport,
 * so we subtract its rect to land in CANVAS-LOCAL px (the renderer's draw space). Behind
 * the camera (`worldToScreen` → null) we return an off-canvas sentinel so the batched draw
 * simply paints that grip out of view (the renderer can't skip a null position).
 *
 * Pure Three.js + the coordinate SSoT — no React, no store, no scene mutation. Jest-friendly.
