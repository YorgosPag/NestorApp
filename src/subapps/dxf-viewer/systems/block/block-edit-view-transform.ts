/**
 * ADR-641 — Block Editor (BEDIT) VIEW transform (pure SSoT).
 *
 * WHY: a `BlockEntity` stores its members in the block DEFINITION's own coordinate space, which can
 * differ from the world drawing by the INSERT `scale` (a furniture block authored in metres inserted
 * into a mm drawing carries `scale ≈ 1000`) and can sit at an arbitrary authoring offset far from the
 * definition origin (geo-referenced blocks). Rendering `block.entities` verbatim (the old
 * `buildBlockEditScene`) therefore showed the sofa 1000× too small and ~18 km off-origin — the ruler
 * read «4 mm» for a 2 m couch.
 *
 * The big-player answer (Revit «Edit Family» / ArchiCAD in-place / Cinema 4D / Figma «edit component»)
 * is to edit the DEFINITION but present it at its REAL-WORLD size, framed around the origin. So the
 * Block Editor is a **transformed VIEW** of the canonical definition:
 *
 *   view(member) = Scale · (member − C)          // scale def→world magnitude, recenter on the origin
 *   def(view)    = C + Scale⁻¹ · view            // the exact inverse, applied on write-back
 *
 * where `Scale` is the instance's own `|block.scale|` MAGNITUDE (mirror/rotation of the instance is
 * deliberately NOT applied — the editor shows the canonical definition) and `C` is the bounds-centre, FIXED at
 * enter time (never recomputed from the live — edited — members, or the view would drift under the
 * cursor mid-edit). The canonical `block.entities` stay untouched (def space) so multi-instance sync
 * (Φ5) and DXF INSERT round-trip are preserved; only the editor's VIEW is transformed, and every edit
 * is inverse-transformed back to def space before it is stored.
 *
 * FULL SSoT reuse — NO new geometry math: both directions are one call to
 * {@link applyBlockTransformGeometry} (`placement + Rot·Scale·(e − base)`), the SAME placement core the
 * INSERT expansion uses, so it already covers EVERY renderable type incl. `hatch.boundaryPaths`.

 * Derive the view transform for `block` from its `scale` + the centre of its members' definition
 * bounds. Call ONCE at enter (the result is stored) so the recenter `C` is fixed for the session and
 * the view does not swim as members are edited. A zero/absent scale axis degrades to 1 (identity axis).
 *
 * ABSOLUTE scale magnitude (`Math.abs`): a mirrored/rotated INSTANCE (`scale.x < 0`, `rotation ≠ 0`)
 * must NOT flip or spin the editor — the big players (AutoCAD BEDIT / Revit «Edit Family» / Figma «edit
 * component») always present the DEFINITION in its canonical, un-mirrored, un-rotated form. The signed
 * scale + rotation live only on the instance (`expandBlockInstance`), so the world drawing stays correct
 * while the editor is canonical. Dropping the sign here keeps `defFromView` (`1/sx`) an exact positive
 * inverse of `viewFromDef`, so the write-back round-trip is unchanged.
