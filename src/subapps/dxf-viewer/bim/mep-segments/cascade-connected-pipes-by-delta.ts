/**
 * Connected-Pipe MOVE Cascade — the delta wrapper over the transform-agnostic engine
 * (ADR-049 / ADR-408 Φ-C, in-command, 2D + 3D).
 *
 * When an MEP connector host (manifold / fixture / boiler / radiator / water-heater)
 * or a pipe segment MOVES, every pipe end snapped to its connectors must FOLLOW
 * (Revit "connected ends move with the element"). This logic previously lived ONLY
 * in the 3D gizmo path (`withConnectedPipeFollow`, which wrapped the move in a
 * `CompoundCommand` of `UpdateMepSegmentParamsCommand`s) — so a 2D drag/nudge/move-
 * tool of an MEP host left its pipes behind.
 *
 * The follow now lives INSIDE the Move commands as a recompute step (mirror of
 * `cascadeHostedOpeningsForWalls` / `cascadeMovedSlabOpenings`): the moved pipes are
 * applied directly and returned for the single `bim:entities-moved` emit (persisted by
 * `useMepSegmentPersistence`'s `useBimEntityMovedPersistEffect`). So EVERY gesture
 * follows pipes for free.
 *
 * This module is the MOVE specialisation of the generic engine in
 * `cascade-connected-pipes.ts`: it derives each entity's next params from the 3D move
 * `delta` (`calculateBimMovedGeometry`) and returns only the moved pipes (move undo
 * re-runs with the reverse delta, so it needs no snapshots). Rotate/scale/mirror reuse
 * the SAME engine from the transform spine — zero divergence.
 *
 * ⚠️ Timing: the follow is OLD→NEW anchor based, so the caller MUST invoke this BEFORE
 * applying the host's own move to the scene. `delta` is the signed move (reverse on undo).
 *
 * @see bim/mep-segments/cascade-connected-pipes.ts — the transform-agnostic engine (SSoT)
 * @see bim/mep-segments/mep-move-propagation.ts — the pure anchor-retarget SSoT
 * @see bim/walls/wall-opening-coordinator.ts — the wall-opening twin
